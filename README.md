## Technologies
This is made by using simple web technologies like html, css and js for frontend and node js with express for backend. EJS was used for rendering dynamic datas. There is no real time data update in the website. For backend, I have used mongodb with mongoose for data modelling. Multer was used to deal with image and video uploads.

## Some Insights
This website is not responsive. So, it looks sick in different devices but cool in my device. If you would like to contribute help making it responsive.

Thanks.
